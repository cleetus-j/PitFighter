# PitFighter
A non-complete disassembly of the PAL SMS version of Pit Fighter.
This was aimed to get answers to a few questions regarding I had for the game, namely why the game is as big as it is, and what makes it tick.
I got answers, so I'll share my findings with the game. The disassembly is not 100%, and it was not the goal, just an exploration in an older game. While this is not finished, there are more than enough comments, mostly my own ramblings and notes.
I'm NOT a z80 programmer, not am I an expert on the field, and I definetly made some mistakes. This was a learning opportunity, and I tried my best to date to tackle the challenge.
-Most variables are labelled, and i've provided some explanation what they might do.
-The code is commented, but it may have a lot of mistakes, take this with a pinch of salt.
-The sound engine is identified mostly, but I'm not really good yet to dissect it properly, same goes for the main logic, and sprite handlers.
-The menu code's blocks are identified, the music tracks, and smaller things.
I did not had a lot of time to do this, but it was a lot of fun. I like the game, and especially the music, it's really good!

If you manage to get a hold of Andrew Taylor, the programmer, please let me know. I would like to chat with him.

A huge thanks goes to Calindro for Emulicious, and its debugger.
